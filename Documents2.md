## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to the development of this Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Special thanks to the open-source community for providing the tools and libraries that made this project possible, including Python, Tkinter, and the pywin32 library for Windows event log access.

We also acknowledge the valuable resources from security research communities that helped in understanding security event patterns and best practices for log monitoring.

## ABSTRACT

This document presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system developed in Python. The application provides real-time security monitoring capabilities by collecting events from multiple data sources including Windows Event Logs, log files, syslog servers, and network connections.

The SIEM system features a modern graphical user interface built with Tkinter, offering a dashboard for security analytics, event browsing, alert management, and configurable data sources. The modular architecture separates concerns between data collection, event processing, and presentation layers, enabling scalability and maintainability.

Key features include pattern-based threat detection using regular expressions, severity classification of security events, and real-time visualization of security metrics. The system processes events from Windows Security, System, and Application logs, monitors custom log files and directories, runs UDP/TCP syslog servers, and tracks network connections using netstat.

Testing demonstrates the system's capability to accurately detect, classify, and display security events across various scenarios including authentication events, network activities, and system changes.

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

In today's digital landscape, organizations face an ever-increasing number of cybersecurity threats. The complexity and volume of security events generated by modern IT infrastructure make manual monitoring virtually impossible. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have emerged as essential tools for collecting, analyzing, and responding to security events in real-time.

Traditional SIEM solutions are often expensive, complex to deploy, and require significant resources to maintain. This creates a barrier for small to medium-sized organizations and individual security researchers who need effective security monitoring capabilities without enterprise-level costs.

The motivation behind this project is to develop a lightweight, accessible SIEM solution that:

1. **Provides real-time monitoring** - Enables immediate visibility into security events across multiple data sources
2. **Uses open-source technologies** - Leverages Python and freely available libraries to minimize costs
3. **Offers an intuitive interface** - Presents security data in a modern, user-friendly dashboard
4. **Supports multiple data sources** - Integrates Windows Event Logs, log files, syslog, and network monitoring
5. **Implements pattern-based detection** - Uses configurable regular expressions to identify security threats

### 1.2 Problem Statement and Scope

**Problem Statement:**

Organizations need to monitor security events across their IT infrastructure to detect and respond to threats. However, existing solutions often present challenges:

- Commercial SIEM products are expensive and complex
- Manual log review is time-consuming and error-prone
- Multiple data sources require different monitoring approaches
- Real-time visibility requires sophisticated event processing

This project addresses these challenges by developing a Python-based SIEM that provides:

- Unified monitoring of multiple security data sources
- Automated pattern-based threat detection
- Real-time event visualization and alerting
- Configurable severity classification

**Scope:**

The SIEM system covers:

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Windows Event Log collection (System, Application, Security) | Cloud-native log collection (AWS, Azure, GCP) |
| Log file and directory monitoring | Machine learning-based anomaly detection |
| Syslog server (UDP/TCP) | Automated incident response |
| Network connection monitoring | Long-term log storage and compliance |
| Pattern-based threat detection | Enterprise integration (SOAR platforms) |
| Real-time dashboard and alerting | Multi-tenant deployment |

### 1.3 Objectives

The primary objectives of this SIEM project are:

1. **Design a modular architecture** - Create a well-structured codebase with separate modules for data collection, event processing, and user interface

2. **Implement multiple data collectors** - Develop collectors for:
   - Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application)
   - Log file monitoring with pattern detection
   - Syslog server supporting UDP and TCP protocols
   - Network connection monitoring using netstat

3. **Create a modern GUI** - Build an intuitive graphical interface featuring:
   - Real-time dashboard with statistics
   - Event browser with search and filtering
   - Alert management panel
   - Data source configuration

4. **Implement threat detection** - Develop pattern-based detection using:
   - Regular expression matching for security events
   - Severity classification (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO)
   - Windows Event ID mapping

5. **Ensure thread safety** - Design the system to handle concurrent data collection without blocking the user interface

6. **Validate through testing** - Perform unit testing to verify correct functionality of core components

## CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have evolved significantly since their inception in the early 2000s. This chapter reviews the foundational concepts, existing solutions, and research that informed the design of this SIEM implementation.

### Evolution of SIEM Technology

SIEM technology emerged from the convergence of two distinct product categories: Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM). SIM systems focused on long-term log storage and compliance reporting, while SEM systems provided real-time monitoring and correlation of security events. Modern SIEM solutions combine both capabilities, offering comprehensive security visibility (Gartner, 2005).

### Core SIEM Functions

According to industry standards and research, a SIEM system should provide the following core functions:

1. **Log Collection** - Aggregating logs from diverse sources including servers, network devices, applications, and security tools
2. **Normalization** - Converting logs into a common format for consistent analysis
3. **Correlation** - Identifying relationships between events to detect complex attack patterns
4. **Alerting** - Generating notifications when security incidents are detected
5. **Reporting** - Providing dashboards and reports for security operations

### Windows Event Logging

Windows operating systems maintain extensive event logs that are crucial for security monitoring. The Windows Event Log service records events in three primary logs:

- **Security Log** - Authentication events, policy changes, and privilege use (requires administrative access)
- **System Log** - Hardware and driver events, service status changes
- **Application Log** - Application-specific events and errors

Microsoft documentation identifies specific Event IDs associated with security-relevant activities, such as Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon) and Event ID 4720 (User Account Created). This project incorporates a comprehensive mapping of over 60 Windows Event IDs to security categories and severity levels.

### Syslog Protocol

The syslog protocol (RFC 5424) provides a standard for transmitting log messages across networks. Syslog messages include a priority value that encodes both facility and severity:
